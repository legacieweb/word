# 🎬 Church Reels - Video Error Fix Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved

**Error:** `Uncaught (in promise) NotSupportedError: The element has no supported sources`

### What Was Wrong:
1. The old video URLs (w3schools) were not working properly
2. No error handling for video play promises
3. Videos needed proper source tags and attributes

### What Was Fixed:

#### 1. **Updated Video Sources** ✅
- Replaced broken URLs with working Google Cloud Storage sample videos
- All 12 videos now use reliable, publicly accessible MP4 files
- Videos include: BigBuckBunny, ElephantsDream, Sintel, TearsOfSteel, etc.

#### 2. **Added Proper Video Attributes** ✅
```html
<video 
  muted              ← Required for autoplay
  preload="metadata" ← Faster loading
  playsinline        ← Better mobile support
>
  <source src="..." type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

#### 3. **Added Error Handling** ✅
```javascript
const playPromise = video.play();
if (playPromise !== undefined) {
  playPromise.catch(error => {
    console.log('Video play prevented:', error);
  });
}
```

#### 4. **Added Mute/Unmute Button** 🔊
- Videos start muted (browser requirement for autoplay)

- Icon changes: 🔇 (muted) ↔ 🔊 (unmuted)
