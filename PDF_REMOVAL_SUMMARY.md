## New Simplified Workflow

### **Before (With PDF):**
1. Admin enters sermon title and PIN
2. Admin selects a PDF book
3. Admin clicks "Prepare Sermon"
4. PDF loads in viewer with page navigation
5. Admin clicks floating "Start Live" button
6. Sermon goes live with PDF broadcasting

### **After (Without PDF):**
1. Admin enters sermon title and PIN
2. Admin clicks "Start Live Sermon"
3. Sermon goes live immediately ✨

## What Still Works

✅ **Audio Recording** - Microphone capture and recording
✅ **Live Duration Tracking** - Real-time sermon duration counter
✅ **Viewer Statistics** - Live viewer count display
✅ **Message Count** - Chat message tracking
✅ **Recording Size** - Audio file size monitoring
✅ **Stop Sermon** - Save recording and end broadcast
✅ **WebSocket Communication** - Real-time updates to viewers

---

## Server Status

✅ Server running on `http://localhost:3000`
✅ MongoDB connected
✅ CORS configured to allow all origins
✅ Static files served from root directory

---

## Access Instructions

**Admin Panel:** `http://localhost:3000/admin.html`
**Viewer Page:** `http://localhost:3000/sermon.html`
**User Dashboard:** `http://localhost:3000/dashboard.html`

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Always access via HTTP server, never by double-clicking HTML files!

## Next Steps (Optional Future Cleanup)

The following server-side components may still contain PDF-related code:

1. **Server API Endpoints** (`server.js`):
   - `/api/pdf-books` - Lists available PDF files
   - `/api/sermons/broadcast-pdf` - Broadcasts PDF page changes
   
2. **Viewer Page** (`sermon.html`):
   - May still have PDF viewing code that should be reviewed

3. **Database Model** (`models/Sermon.js`):
   - `pdfPath` field likely still exists
   - `currentPdfPage` field likely still exists

4. **WebSocket Handlers** (`server.js`):
   - PDF page change broadcasting logic may still exist

These can be cleaned up if you want to completely remove PDF support from the entire system.
