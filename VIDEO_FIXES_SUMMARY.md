# Video Playback Fixes - Complete Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **Video Not Playing When Swiping/Scrolling**
**Issue**: Videos would fail to play when scrolling between videos, especially when going back to previous videos.

**Root Cause**: 
- Multiple scroll event listeners being added without cleanup
- Duplicate `canplay` event listeners causing conflicts
- Videos not being properly reset when switching

**Solution**:
- Implemented single scroll listener with proper cleanup
- Added `scrollListenerAttached` flag to prevent duplicate listeners
- Clear all event listeners (`oncanplay`, `onloadeddata`) before setting new ones
- Properly pause and reset all other videos before playing new one

### 2. **Videos Not Playing After Returning to Previous Video**
**Issue**: After watching video 5, going back to video 3 wouldn't play.

**Root Cause**:
- Event listeners accumulating on video elements
- Video state not being properly reset
- `setupVideoControls` adding duplicate listeners every time

**Solution**:
- Created `videoControlsSetup` Set to track which videos have controls
- Prevent duplicate control setup with tracking
- Clear tracking when closing watch mode
- Reset video state completely when switching

### 3. **All Videos Playing Sound When Jumping from Last to First**
**Issue**: When scrolling from the last video to the first video, all videos would start playing sound simultaneously.

**Root Cause**:
- Multiple videos trying to play at once
- No mechanism to ensure only one video plays
- Event listeners firing for multiple videos

**Solution**:
- Added `foundActiveVideo` flag to ensure only ONE video plays
- Stop ALL other videos completely before playing new one
- Clear pending event listeners on all non-active videos
- Pause all videos immediately during scroll

### 4. **Videos Requiring Page Refresh to Work**
**Issue**: After errors, videos wouldn't play until page refresh.

**Root Cause**:
- Event listeners not being cleaned up
- Video elements in broken state
- Memory leaks from accumulated listeners

**Solution**:
- Proper cleanup in `closeWatchMode` function
- Clear all event listeners when closing
- Reset video controls tracking
- Remove scroll listener properly

### 5. **Video Loading Issues**
**Issue**: Videos not loading properly when selected.

**Root Cause**:
- No explicit `video.load()` call
- No readiness check before playing
- Race conditions with video loading

**Solution**:
- Force `video.load()` when video not ready
- Check `readyState >= 3` before playing
- Use `oncanplay` callback (not addEventListener) to avoid duplicates
- Added 2-second fallback timeout for slow connections

## Technical Improvements

### Event Listener Management
```javascript
// Before: Multiple listeners added repeatedly
video.addEventListener('canplay', handler);

// After: Single listener using property assignment
video.oncanplay = () => {
  video.oncanplay = null; // Clear immediately
  attemptPlayback();
};
```

### Scroll Listener Cleanup
```javascript
// Track listener state
let scrollListenerAttached = false;
let scrollHandler = null;

// Remove before adding new
if (scrollListenerAttached && scrollHandler) {
  watchMode.removeEventListener('scroll', scrollHandler);
}

// Add new listener
watchMode.addEventListener('scroll', scrollHandler);
scrollListenerAttached = true;
```

### Video Controls Tracking
```javascript
// Prevent duplicate control setup
const videoControlsSetup = new Set();

function setupVideoControls(video, index) {
  const videoId = `video-${index}`;
  if (videoControlsSetup.has(videoId)) return;
  videoControlsSetup.add(videoId);
  // ... setup controls
}
```

### Single Video Playback Guarantee
```javascript
let foundActiveVideo = false;

videoSlides.forEach((slide, index) => {
  if (isInView && !foundActiveVideo) {
    foundActiveVideo = true; // Only first in-view video
    // Stop ALL other videos
    videoSlides.forEach((otherSlide, otherIndex) => {
      if (otherIndex !== index) {
        const otherVideo = otherSlide.querySelector('video');
        otherVideo.pause();
        otherVideo.currentTime = 0;
        otherVideo.oncanplay = null;
      }
    });
    playCurrentVideo(video, index);
  }
});
```

## Files Modified
- `d:\desktop\church\reels.html`

## Key Changes by Line Number

1. **Lines 1263-1344**: Rewrote `setupScrollListener()` with proper cleanup
2. **Lines 1346-1416**: Rewrote `playCurrentVideo()` with better loading logic
3. **Lines 1612-1661**: Updated `setupVideoControls()` to prevent duplicates
4. **Lines 1207-1234**: Integrated dynamic preloading into main scroll handler
5. **Lines 1237-1273**: Enhanced `closeWatchMode()` with complete cleanup

## Testing Checklist

✅ Click video from gallery → Should autoplay immediately
✅ Scroll down to next video → Should play smoothly
✅ Scroll back to previous video → Should play without issues
✅ Jump from video 90 to video 2 → Should work smoothly
✅ Jump from last video to first video → Only one video should play
✅ Close and reopen watch mode → Should work without refresh
✅ Rapid scrolling → Should handle gracefully
✅ Sound toggle → Should work on current video
✅ Like button → Should work correctly
✅ Share/Download → Should work correctly

## Performance Improvements

1. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
2. **Bandwidth Optimization**: Smart preloading (auto/metadata/none)
3. **Smooth Scrolling**: Pause videos during scroll, play when stopped
4. **No Duplicate Listeners**: Tracking prevents accumulation
5. **Faster Response**: 150ms scroll timeout for stability

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari (iOS/macOS)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (Android/iOS)

## Known Limitations

1. Autoplay with sound may be blocked by browser policies (falls back to muted)
2. Very slow connections may show preloader for longer
3. Large video files may take time to load initially

## Future Enhancements

1. Add video caching for frequently watched videos
2. Implement predictive preloading based on scroll direction
3. Add keyboard shortcuts for navigation
4. Implement video quality selection
5. Add playback speed controls
